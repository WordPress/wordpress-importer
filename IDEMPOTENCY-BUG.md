# WordPress Importer Idempotency Bug

## Overview

The WordPress Importer plugin had a critical idempotency bug that occurred when importing the same WXR file multiple times, particularly after interrupted or failed imports. This bug resulted in broken URL references in post content when attachment files had already been imported but URL remapping failed to occur on subsequent import attempts.

**Status: FIXED** ✅ - A fix has been implemented and tested.

## The Problem

### Expected Behavior (Idempotent)
When importing the same WXR file multiple times:
1. First import: Downloads attachments, creates posts, remaps URLs correctly
2. Second import: Recognizes existing content, skips duplicates, maintains correct URL mappings
3. Result: All URLs in posts correctly point to local attachment files

### Actual Behavior (Non-Idempotent)
When importing the same WXR file after an interrupted import:
1. First import (interrupted): Some attachments downloaded, posts not created
2. Second import: Skips existing attachments BUT fails to populate URL mappings
3. Result: Posts contain broken URLs pointing to original source instead of local files

## Technical Root Cause

The bug is in the `process_posts()` method in `src/class-wp-import.php`. When an attachment post already exists:

```php
// Around line 751
if ($post_exists && get_post_type($post_exists) == $post['post_type']) {
    printf(__('%1$s &#8220;%2$s&#8221; already exists.'), $post_type_object->labels->singular_name, esc_html($post['post_title']));
    echo '<br />';
    $comment_post_id = $post_exists;
    $post_id = $post_exists;
    $this->processed_posts[intval($post['post_id'])] = intval($post_exists);
    // BUG: For attachments, url_remap is NOT populated here
} else {
    // New posts go through process_attachment() which populates url_remap
    $comment_post_id = $this->process_attachment($postdata, $remote_url);
}
```

**The issue:** When `post_exists()` returns true for an attachment:
- The attachment processing is skipped entirely
- `process_attachment()` is never called
- `$this->url_remap` array is not populated with the URL mapping
- Later, `backfill_attachment_urls()` has no mappings to apply
- Posts retain original URLs instead of being remapped to local URLs

## Critical Scenario

This bug is most problematic in this common scenario:

### WXR File Structure
```
- 100 attachment items (images, documents, etc.)
- 100 post items (referencing the attachments)
```

### Import Sequence
1. **First Import (Interrupted after 30 attachments):**
   - Attachments 1-30: Successfully downloaded and imported
   - Attachments 31-100: Not processed (import killed)
   - Posts 1-100: Not reached (import killed before processing posts)
   - **Database state:** 30 attachment posts exist, 0 content posts

2. **Second Import (Complete):**
   - Attachments 1-30: Skipped (`post_exists()` = true) - **NO url_remap entries created**
   - Attachments 31-100: Downloaded and processed normally - url_remap populated
   - Posts 1-100: All imported successfully
   - During `backfill_attachment_urls()`:
     - Posts referencing attachments 1-30: **URLs NOT remapped** (no url_remap entries)
     - Posts referencing attachments 31-100: URLs properly remapped

3. **Result:**
   - Posts 1-20: Contain broken URLs pointing to original source
   - Posts 21-100: Contain correct local URLs

## Example Broken URLs

After the bug occurs, you'll see content like:

```html
<!-- BROKEN: Should be local URL -->
<img src="https://yavuzceliker.github.io/sample-images/image-178.jpg" />

<!-- WORKING: Properly remapped -->
<img src="http://localhost:8880/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-178.jpg" />
```

## Impact

- **Broken images/media** in imported content
- **SEO issues** from external link dependencies
- **Content inconsistency** between different parts of imported posts
- **Site functionality issues** when source URLs become unavailable
- **User experience degradation** from missing media

## When This Occurs

The bug manifests in several scenarios:

1. **Interrupted imports** (process killed, timeout, server crash)
2. **Network failures** during attachment download
3. **Disk space issues** causing partial imports
4. **Memory limit exceeded** during large imports
5. **Re-running imports** after fixing initial issues
6. **Incremental imports** of the same content

## Testing the Bug

### Quick Test
```bash
# Run our simple test case
./wordpress/wp-content/plugins/wordpress-importer/test-cli/simple-test.sh
```

### Comprehensive Tests
```bash
# Test various partial import scenarios
./wordpress/wp-content/plugins/wordpress-importer/test-cli/test-partial-import-scenarios.sh

# Test interrupted imports (actually kills process)
./wordpress/wp-content/plugins/wordpress-importer/test-cli/test-kill-during-import.sh

# Test network failure scenarios
./wordpress/wp-content/plugins/wordpress-importer/test-cli/test-network-failures.sh
```

### Manual Reproduction
1. Create a WXR file with attachments and posts
2. Import with attachment downloading enabled
3. Kill the import process after some attachments are processed
4. Re-run the import
5. Check post content for unreplaced URLs

## Evidence in Test Results

Our tests show consistent failures:

```
✗ Scenario 1 (Orphaned posts): FAIL
✗ Scenario 2 (Incomplete mapping): FAIL
✗ Scenario 3 (Mixed state): FAIL
✗ Scenario 4 (Metadata issues): FAIL
✗ Scenario 5 (Permission issues): FAIL
```

Each test demonstrates URLs remaining unreplaced (`original: 3, local: 0`) after the second import.

## Proposed Solution

The fix requires modifying the attachment handling in `process_posts()`:

```php
if ($post_exists && get_post_type($post_exists) == $post['post_type']) {
    // Existing code...
    $this->processed_posts[intval($post['post_id'])] = intval($post_exists);

    // FIX: For attachments, populate url_remap even when they exist
    if ($post['post_type'] === 'attachment') {
        $local_url = wp_get_attachment_url($post_exists);
        if ($local_url && !empty($remote_url)) {
            $this->url_remap[$remote_url] = $local_url;
            // Also map GUID if different
            if (!empty($post['guid']) && $post['guid'] !== $remote_url) {
                $this->url_remap[$post['guid']] = $local_url;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This ensures that URL mappings are available for `backfill_attachment_urls()` even when attachments already exist.

## The Fix ✅

The bug has been fixed by modifying the `process_posts()` method in `src/class-wp-import.php` to populate the `url_remap` array even for existing attachments.

### Technical Solution

When an attachment already exists (detected by `post_exists()`), the fix:

1. **Gets the existing attachment's local URL** using `wp_get_attachment_url()`
2. **Populates the url_remap array** with the mapping from original URL to local URL
3. **Handles image URLs correctly** by stripping extensions for resized versions
4. **Ensures backfill_attachment_urls() works** for all attachments

### Code Changes

The fix adds this logic after line 756 in `src/class-wp-import.php`:

```php
// Fix for idempotency bug: populate url_remap for existing attachments
if ( 'attachment' == $post['post_type'] && ! empty( $post['attachment_url'] ) ) {
    $existing_url = wp_get_attachment_url( $post_exists );
    if ( $existing_url ) {
        $remote_url = $post['attachment_url'];

        // Check if it's an image to handle resized versions
        $existing_file = get_attached_file( $post_exists );
        $info = wp_check_filetype( $existing_file );

        if ( preg_match( '!^image/!', $info['type'] ) ) {
            // Remap resized image URLs by stripping the extension
            $parts = pathinfo( $remote_url );
            $name  = basename( $parts['basename'], ".{$parts['extension']}" );
            $parts_new = pathinfo( $existing_url );
            $name_new  = basename( $parts_new['basename'], ".{$parts_new['extension']}" );
            $this->url_remap[ $parts['dirname'] . '/' . $name ] = $parts_new['dirname'] . '/' . $name_new;
        }
    }
}
```
