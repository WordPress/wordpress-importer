	/**
	 * Returns the next event related to any of the HTTP
	 * requests enqueued in this client.
	 *
	 * ## Events
	 *
	 * The returned event is a ClientEvent with $event->name
	 * being one of the following:
	 *
	 * * `Client::EVENT_GOT_HEADERS`
	 * * `Client::EVENT_BODY_CHUNK_AVAILABLE`
	 * * `Client::EVENT_FAILED`
	 * * `Client::EVENT_FINISHED`
	 *
	 * See the ClientEvent class for details on each event.
	 *
	 * Once an event is consumed, it is removed from the
	 * event queue and will not be returned again.
	 *
	 * When there are no events available, this function
	 * blocks and waits for the next one. If all requests
	 * have already finished, and we are not waiting for
	 * any more events, it returns false.
	 *
	 * ## Filtering
	 *
	 * The $query parameter can be used to filter the events
	 * that are returned. It can contain the following keys:
	 *
	 * * `request_id` â€“ The ID of the request to consider.
	 *
	 * For example, to only consider the next `EVENT_GOT_HEADERS`
	 * event for a specific request, you can use:
	 *
	 * ```php
	 * $request = new Request( "https://w.org" );
	 *
	 * $client = new HttpClientClient();
	 * $client->enqueue( $request );
	 * $event = $client->await_next_event( [
	 *    'request_id' => $request->id,
	 * ] );
	 * ```
	 *
	 * Importantly, filtering does not consume unrelated events.
	 * You can await all the events for a request #2, and
	 * then await the next event for request #1 even if the
	 * request #1 has finished before you started awaiting
	 * events for request #2.
	 *
	 * @param $query
	 *
	 * @return bool
