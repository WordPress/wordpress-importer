    DTD describing a database of XML tests.

    NOTE:  the OASIS/NIST test effort also has a DTD for its test
    environment, but that DTD is not yet suited for automated test
    processing.  (Among other issues, it doesn't record information
    putting any test case into the test matrix.)  If that gets fixed,
    it may be useful to switch over to that DTD.

<!--
    The root element of the whole collection is TESTSUITE.  While not
    very different from TESTCASES, it must be distinguished due to
    improper processing by IE5.

<!--
    The root element of a collection should be "TESTCASES".  It groups 
    a set of tests in a particular "PROFILE", which is descriptive.  For
    example, a "Japanese" profile might group tests with documents
    in standard Japanese encodings, using Japanese characters used
    inside names and name tokens as well as inside text.  Or the
    profile might be associated with the test supplier.

<!--
    The body of each TEST element is its description, used
    to evaluate the diagnostic produced on negative tests.
    People will generally read this to evaluate whether the
    test failed for the correct reason.

    The type of (external) ENTITIES required affect the results
    permitted for certain types of nonvalidating parsers.  In
    some cases, errors (even well-formedness errors) can't be seen
    without reading external parameter or general entities.

    Each test has a unique ID used in diagnostics.

    Tests with an OUTPUT attribute do dual duty:  not only must parsers
    accept the test, but the data they report must also have "Second
    Canonical Form" as found in the specified output file.  (This is
    what James Clark titled "Canonical XML", with the addition of the
    NOTATION declarations that all XML parsers are required to report.)

    The OUTPUT3 attribute is like OUTPUT, but when sent through a
    validating parser the data reported must have the "Third Canonical
    Form" as found in the specified output file.  (This is Second
    Canonical form, with declarations of unparsed ENTITY values and
    with all ignorable whitespace removed.)

    The canonical forms are changed slightly for output files corresponding
    to XML 1.1 input files.  They start with an XML declaration specifying the
    version number, and use character references for all C0 and C1 controls.
    The grammars are changed as follows:


    CanonXML    ::= '<?xml version="1.1">' Pi* element Pi*
    CanonXML2   ::= '<?xml version="1.1">' DTD2? Pi* element Pi*
    CanonXML3   ::= '<?xml version="1.1">' DTD3? Pi* element Pi*
    C0          ::= (Unicode characters #x1-#x1F)
    C1          ::= (Unicode characters #x7F-#x9F)
    EscapedC0   ::= (Decimal references to C0 characters, &#1; - &#31;)
    EscapedC1   ::= (Decimal references to C1 characters, &#127; - &#159;)
    Datachar    ::= '&amp;' | '&lt;' | '&gt;' | '&quot;'
                  | EscapedC0 | EscapedC1
                  | (Char - ('&' | '<' | '>' | '"' | C0 | C1))


    where Char is the XML 1.1 rather than 1.0 production of that name.
 

    Tests apply to one or more particular SECTIONS.

    Each test has a TYPE:
    * All parsers must accept "valid" testcases.
    * Nonvalidating parsers must also accept "invalid" testcases,
      but validating ones must reject them.
    * No parser should accept a "not-wf" testcase unless it's a
      nonvalidating parser and the test contains external entities
      that the parser doesn't read.
    * Parsers are not required to report "errors".

    Each test is in a particular XML document, with a URI.  If these
    tests are accessed over a network, the path will be relative to
    the base URI of the document holding the testcase.

    Tests which apply only to certain versions of XML list those versions
    in the VERSION attribute.  An absent VERSION implies that the test
    applies to all versions.  Parsers should not run tests for versions
    they do not support.

    Tests which apply only to certain editions of XML list those editions
    in the EDITION attribute.  An absent EDITION implies that the test
    applies to all editions.  Parsers should not run tests for editions
    they do not support.  VERSION should have a single value if
    EDITION has a value.

    Parsers should enable namespace processing except for tests marked
    with NAMESPACES="no".  These are tests that use colons in ways
    inconsistent with the Namespaces spec.
