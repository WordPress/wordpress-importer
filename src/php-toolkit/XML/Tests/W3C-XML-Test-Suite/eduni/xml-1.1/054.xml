<!-- Contains a character reference to a C0 control character (form-feed)
     in an entity value.  This will be legal (in XML 1.1) when the entity
     declaration is parsed, but what about when it is used?  According to
     the grammar in the CR spec, it should be illegal (because the 
     replacement text must match "content"), but this is probably not
     intended. -->
