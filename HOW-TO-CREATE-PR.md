git commit -m "Fix idempotency bug: URL remapping for existing attachments

When importing a WXR file after an interrupted import, existing attachments
were not added to the url_remap array, causing broken URLs in post content.

This fix ensures that when an attachment already exists (detected by
post_exists()), the url_remap array is properly populated with the
mapping from the original URL to the local URL.

Changes:
- Modified process_posts() in class-wp-import.php to populate url_remap
  for existing attachments
- Added comprehensive PHPUnit tests for idempotency scenarios
- Added shell script tests for development verification
- Added test data files simulating interrupted imports

Fixes: WordPress/wordpress-importer#[ISSUE_NUMBER]"
```

### 5. Push to Your Fork

## Description

Fixes an idempotency bug where URL remapping fails for existing attachments during resumed imports.

## The Problem

When an import is interrupted and resumed:
1. Existing attachments are skipped (correctly)
2. BUT their URLs are not added to the url_remap array (bug)
3. Result: Posts contain broken external URLs instead of local URLs

### Example of the Bug

```html
<!-- BROKEN: External URL remains after resumed import -->
<img src="https://yavuzceliker.github.io/sample-images/image-178.jpg" />

<!-- EXPECTED: Should be remapped to local URL -->
<img src="http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-178.jpg" />
```

## The Solution

Modified `process_posts()` in `class-wp-import.php` to populate the `url_remap` array even for existing attachments, ensuring URLs are properly remapped during `backfill_attachment_urls()`.

### Code Changes

Added URL remapping logic after line 756 when an attachment already exists:

```php
// Fix for idempotency bug: populate url_remap for existing attachments
if ( 'attachment' == $post['post_type'] && ! empty( $post['attachment_url'] ) ) {
    $existing_url = wp_get_attachment_url( $post_exists );
    if ( $existing_url ) {
        // Map remote URL to local URL
        $remote_url = $post['attachment_url'];

        // Handle resized image URLs...
        // [code continues]
    }
}
```

## Testing

### Automated Tests Included

- ‚úÖ **PHPUnit Test Suite** (`phpunit/tests/idempotency.php`)
  - Tests partial import ‚Üí complete import ‚Üí URL verification
  - Compatible with WordPress core testing infrastructure
  - Ready for CI/CD integration

- ‚úÖ **Shell Script Tests** (`test-cli/`)
  - `simple-test.sh` - Demonstrates the bug and verifies the fix
  - `test-patch.sh` - Tests applying the patch
  - `run-phpunit-style-test.sh` - PHPUnit-equivalent test

- ‚úÖ **Test Data Files**
  - `phpunit/data/idempotency-partial.xml` - 1 attachment (simulates interruption)
  - `phpunit/data/idempotency-complete.xml` - 3 attachments + 3 posts (full import)

### Test Results

**Before Fix:**
```
‚ùå Post 1: URLs NOT remapped (references skipped attachment)
‚úÖ Posts 2-3: URLs properly remapped (reference new attachments)
üî¥ IDEMPOTENCY BUG CONFIRMED
```

**After Fix:**
```
‚úÖ Post 1: URLs properly remapped to local files
‚úÖ Post 2: URLs properly remapped to local files
‚úÖ Post 3: URLs properly remapped to local files
‚úÖ All URLs properly remapped - no idempotency issues
```

## How to Test Locally

1. **Quick Test:**
   ```bash
   cd test-cli
   bash simple-test.sh
   ```

2. **PHPUnit Test (requires WordPress test environment):**
   ```bash
   phpunit --group idempotency
   ```

3. **Test the Patch:**
   ```bash
   cd test-cli
   bash test-patch.sh
   ```

## Files Changed

- `src/class-wp-import.php` - Core bug fix
- `phpunit/tests/idempotency.php` - PHPUnit test suite
- `phpunit/data/*.xml` - Test data files
- `test-cli/` - Shell script tests
- `*.md` - Documentation

## Impact

This fix ensures WordPress imports are truly idempotent, preventing broken media URLs when imports are interrupted and resumed - a common scenario in production environments.

Fixes #[ISSUE_NUMBER] (if there's an existing issue)
